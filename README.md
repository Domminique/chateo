## Inspiration
Africa is home to the youngest population in the world, with its
population estimated to double by 2050 - which promises a demographic dividend
unique to the continent. These changing population dynamics mean that about 15 to 20
million young people are expected to join the workforce every year for the next three
decades. 

Lack of digital infrastructure and resources in many African regions has widened educational disparities as a result many students, particularly those in underserved communities, lack access to proper educational resources and face challenges in remote learning. This problem hinders their academic progress and future prospects.
## What it does
**Ngalia* is an inclusive and scalable online education platform tailored to African needs offers curriculum-aligned content, live virtual classrooms, and interactive learning experiences. It will is accessible on various devices, ensuring inclusivity even in regions with limited internet access. The innovation lies in providing affordable, quality education that caters to the specific challenges of the African context.
- Accessible and affordable education for underserved communities.
- Curriculum-aligned content and live virtual classrooms for quality learning.
- Interactive and engaging learning experiences to keep students motivated.
- Customized content to address local challenges and promote relevant skills.
- The opportunity for educators to reach a wider audience and for students to access quality education.

## How we built it
We have built it to  leverages technology by using a combination of the following:
- **Online Learning Platform:** We use a user-friendly online platform to deliver lessons and interactive content.
- **Mobile Learning:** Recognizing the prevalence of mobile devices in Africa, the platform will be mobile-friendly, we chose React Native becase it enables to build an app that works well on both Android and iOS devices.
- **SignalWire Integration:** SignalWire's products  facilitates real-time communication between students and teachers, we used both chats and Video APIs to enable interactive learning
- **GraphQL API:** We'll use GraphQL to optimize data retrieval and enhance the platform's performance.
## Challenges we ran into
Since Africa is faced with low internet connectivity and some places have zero connectivity , we had to think offline-first approach which added complexity to our architecture 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a sustainable and scalable business model for our solution and forming close and tight working relationship with my teammate.
## What we learned
During our development phase we learnt that existing alternatives in the education sector in Africa often lack inclusivity and affordability and alos competitors included traditional schools, expensive e-learning platforms, and government initiatives. However, these alternatives do not fully address the unique challenges of remote, equitable education in Africa
## What's next for Ngalia
With Ngalia we hope not only to protect and re-create struggling sectors but also to redefine education for a brighter future on the continent.
